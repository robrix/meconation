# meconation

Meconation was a iOS side scrolling city builder that was eventually put aside for greater things.
The game had a lot of features planned, and was going really well, the problem was balancing. Meconation was
and still is not the most fun game. As well we wanted to develop a slightly more complex project (SPACE).
And so Meconation was put on the backburner while we hacked away at our new game SPACE and until we could figure out
how to make it more enjoyable.

Meconation, we will come back for you someday...
